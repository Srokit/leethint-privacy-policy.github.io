  <h2 id="whatdatawetakefromuser">What data we take from user</h2>
  <p>Leethint captures and transmits one thing from the user. The thing that we capture
  is the URL that the user's browser is pointing to while using the extension.</p>
  <p>We use the URL to determine which problem on leetcode.com the user is on. We specfically extract the problem ID from the URL. This problem ID is then passed to the API backend so that a hint for that particular problem can be returned.</p>
  <p>We do not capture URLs for any pages other than ones that start with leetcode.com/</p>
  <p>No other data is taken from the page of the user as they are navigating with the extension on because the hints are generated beforehand by another process completely separately from the user's browsing experience.</p>
  <h2 id="ourpromise">Our promise</h2>
  <p>Leethint will never take any data from the user including personal information that is not explicity stated in this Privacy Policy. Leethint does not sell user data.</p>
